# Customer Segmentation in the USA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using unsupervised learning and interactive visualization.  
The goal is to group customers based on their demographics and spending behavior, enabling businesses to design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

The project includes:
1. **Data Modeling & Segmentation** – Preprocessing, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.  
2. **Interactive Dashboard** – A Plotly Dash application to explore customer clusters.

## 🎯 Key Highlights
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer demographics and spending patterns.  
- Implemented **KMeans clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups.  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization of clusters.  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** with Plotly Dash to make insights accessible for decision-making.  
- Delivered an **end-to-end pipeline**: from raw data → machine learning → visualization → dashboard.
